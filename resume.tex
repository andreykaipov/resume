\section{Experience}
\cventryoneline{May 2022 -- Present}{Software Engineer}{GitHub}{Miami, FL}{Remote}{
  \begin{itemize}
  % \item
  %   Refactored GitHub's logging pipeline by using many tiny default Azure
  %   Event Hub clusters in the queueing layer rather than a handful of beefier
  %   bespoke clusters, not only simplifying management of the pipeline but
  %   improving efficiency as well.
  \item
    Managed the infrastructure for macOS runners for both GitHub Actions anud
    Azure DevOps, coordinating between cloud procurement, system integrators,
    and obscure Azure teams to make ``MacCloud'' a reality.
  \item
    Automated as much as possible of the bootstrapping, validation,
    inventory, and telemetry for the management servers, switches, and macOS
    hosts in our racks, working around Microsoft's endless red tape and
    Apple's EULA.
  \item
    Created tooling to make it easier managing our legacy ``trashcan Mac''
    racks, speeding up DRI response times.
  \item
    Automated the validation of Datadog agent version upgrades across 85k hosts.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventryoneline{Feb 2022 -- Aug 2023}{Lead Site Reliability Engineer}{Target}{Miami, FL}{Remote}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Developed a Terraform-like tool for Target's PaaS that allowed users to
    describe their applications as Kubernetes-inspired YAML manifests,
    allowing users to bundle their deployment configs right alongside their
    code, instead of manually managing deployments through monotonous clicks
    in the UI.
  \item
    Worked on a handful of proof-of-concepts to help bring tracing to the
    organization by writing and contributing upstream a variety of custom
    OpenTelemetry processors, exporters, and extensions to adhere to Target's
    standards.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventryoneline{June 2020 -- Feb 2022}{Sr Site Reliability Engineer}{Ultimate Kronos Group}{Weston, FL}{Remote}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Developed and maintained Terraform modules abstracting development teams'
    access to public cloud services, and created workflows to promote
    a seamless and transparent user experience transitioning from the private
    cloud system.
  \item
    Developed tooling to automate the management of volume snapshots and
    backups for our MySQL and MongoDB services
    % (which were actually nonexistent at the time)
    to meet some short-notice compliance audit deadlines.
  \item
    Worked closely with traditional Windows sysadmins and application owners to
    automate the heavily involved and manual configuration of our core products via
    Ansible playbooks, evangelizing SRE principles along the way.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventryoneline{Jan 2020 -- June 2020}{Site Reliability Engineer}{Magic Leap}{Plantation, FL}{Hybrid}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Developed Kubernetes operators to manage GCP resources to extend our platform so we could migrate from AWS.
  % \item
  %   Evangelized the technologies of our SRE sister-squads to our product
  %   teams, while helping them transition to newer company-wide standards.
  % \item
  %   Performed housekeeping across the SRE organization -- upgraded Terraform
  %   AWS and GCP modules and projects to use the latest versions, upgraded
  %   Concourse pipelines, migrated images from ECR and GCR to our private
  %   Docker registry, and added reusable features to our internal tooling.
  \end{itemize}
}
\cventryoneline{Jan 2017 -- Jan 2020}{Site Reliability Engineer}{Ultimate Software}{Weston, FL}{Hybrid}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Developed and managed a centralized logging and metrics collection platform
    for company-wide use, ingesting over 5TB/day of logs and metrics into our
    milti-datacenter Elasticsearch and InfluxDB clusters.
  \item
    Managed several VM and container-based orchestration platforms for product
    teams to leverage, including a homegrown PaaS, on-prem Pivotal Cloud Foundry,
    and on-prem Kubernetes clusters.
  % \item
  %   Partnered with product teams to help developers learn our infrastructure and
  %   internal tooling, and how best to productionalize their applications and
  %   processes.
  \item
    Did all the other silly SRE things, e.g. automated toil away, tracked
    outages, conducted postmortems, troubleshot all kinds of systems, woke up at
    4am because someone from the NOC called the wrong number by accident.
  \end{itemize}
